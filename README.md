# A daemon that polls a friendly emergency button via an Arduino.

Emergency buttons are always handy in emergencies such as:

* Bullshit emergency
* Idiot emergency
* Pr0n emergency
* Yodel emergency
* You name them.

The Arduino PDE is near final, the daemon still is a rough draft.

Relax, it's just a toy project. :-)
